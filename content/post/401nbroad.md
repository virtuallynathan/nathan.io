I had the chance to attend the grand opening of new space in 401 N Broad a few weeks ago. A company called Netrality bought the building and setup
a lot of modern infrastructure the building was missing - new fiber risers between floors, a meet-me-room, new power and cooling, etc.
Here are some photos from inside the newly built out area.

This is the new meet-me-room, this section is for passive equipment and fiber shelves

The fiber from the meet-me-room is run into the colo space on these risers, and is very nicely cable-laced.

They ran new fiber risers between all the floors in an old elevator shaft. They do not charge recurring Cross-connect fees.

Some Tier-1 Providers have already moved into the space, I believe this is TeliaSonera IC. They have some Infinera transport gear and Juniper routers/switches.
