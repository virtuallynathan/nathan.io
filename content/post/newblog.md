This is the new home of my blog! I'll still keep my old blog, [Autonomous System](http://www.autonomoussystem.net/) around for now. This one is 
self-hosted on DigitalOcean (I'll move it to a Colo box soon), and runs HTTP/2 with SSL. I hope to blog a bit more frequently about stuff
that I find interesting. I may update and re-post a few older items as well.
